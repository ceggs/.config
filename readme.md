# dotfiles

## Overview

This repository outlines the use of `nix` and `home-manager` to manage configuration files (dotfiles). The primary feature is the ability to control the `.config` path using a custom `.dotfiles` directory, with configurations being automatically regenerated by `nix` whenever `home-manager` is refreshed.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Nix Installation

It's recommended installing Nix using The Determinate Nix Installer. For more information, visit [zero-to-nix.com](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-installer).

To install, run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

### 2. Installing home-manager

To install home-manager, you need flake.nix and home.nix files:

First, add these files to your git repository:

```bash
git add .
```

Then, install home-manager using the following command:

```bash
nix run github:nix-community/home-manager -- switch --flake .
```

### 3. Usage of home-manager

To use home-manager, execute the default command in the directory containing home.nix and flake.nix:

```bash
home-manager switch --flake .
```

## Aliases

The following system-wide commands are configured in the .zshrc file:

#### hm-switch

##### Switch to a different configuration (defualt:)

``` bash
home-manager switch --flake ~/.dotfiles
```

#### hm-conf-zshrc

#### ## Edit the .zshrc file (defualt:)

``` bash
vim ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc
```

#### hm-conf-home

##### Edit the home.nix file (defualt:)

``` bash
vim ~/.dotfiles/home.nix
```
